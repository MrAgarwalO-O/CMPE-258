# Assignment 07 - Computer vision assignments

## Assignment Description

### Part 01 - Supervised contrastive learning - Using new loss 

Write a colab to demonstrate supervised contrastive learning loss based supervised classification versus regular softmax based one. Please provide necessary visualizations.

### Part 02 - Transfer Learning on Various Modalities

Write simple colabs to transfer learn on images, videos, audios - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecases.

### Part 03 - Zero-Shot Transfer Learning

Write a colab showcasing the following:

- zero-shot transfer learning using the CLIP model
- transfer learning using state of art models from tfhub (Eg: use bigtransfer for example)
