# Developing Agents with Python and Langchain: A Theoretical Guide

This assignment was about creating various types of agents using Python tools such as OpenAI, Gradio, and Langchain. It focuses on writing an agent from scratch and demonstrating various agent types within a Colab environment, without delving into code execution or environment setup details.

## Overview

The guide explores the creation and demonstration of the following agent types:

1. **Basic Agent Using OpenAI and Gradio:** This agent leverages the OpenAI API for processing natural language input and Gradio for creating a user-friendly interface. The agent is designed to engage in conversation, providing helpful and creative responses.
2. **Zero-Shot Prompting Agent:** Utilizes the Langchain library to send prompts to a large language model (LLM) without the need for specific training on the task, demonstrating the model's ability to generate responses based on general knowledge.
3. **Conversational React Agent:** A more sophisticated agent capable of maintaining context and history in a conversation, allowing for more coherent and context-aware interactions over a series of exchanges.
4. **React Docstore Agent:** Demonstrates integrating document storage capabilities with an LLM, enabling the agent to provide answers based on a predefined set of documents and their associated keywords.
5. **Self-Ask with Search Agent:** Combines the power of LLMs with external search capabilities, allowing the agent to perform searches based on the conversation context and incorporate the findings into its responses.

## Creating a Basic Agent

The basic agent is built using OpenAI for natural language processing and Gradio for the interface, facilitating an interactive chatbot that can engage users in conversation. This agent showcases the integration of AI models with web interfaces to create accessible and practical applications.

## Demonstrating Advanced Agent Types with Langchain

Langchain, a powerful library for building and deploying language models, is utilized to demonstrate more complex agents:

- **Zero-Shot Prompting Agent:** This agent showcases the ability of language models to understand and respond to prompts without prior specific training on those prompts.
- **Conversational React Agent:** Enhances the basic agent by maintaining a conversation history, allowing for more nuanced and contextually relevant interactions.
- **React Docstore Agent:** Integrates a simple document store, enabling the agent to reference stored information when responding to queries, illustrating a basic form of knowledge retrieval.
- **Self-Ask with Search Agent:** Demonstrates an advanced capability where the agent can perform external searches as part of its problem-solving process, showing the potential for LLMs to interact with and utilize external data sources.
