## CMPE-258 Deep Learning
## Assignment 1
### Build models using teachable machines
This assignment was to build one **image model**, one **pose model**, one **audio model** using **teachable machines**.

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes it fast and easy to create machine learning models for your projects, without requiring any coding experience.
## Image Model
- For the Image model, I used the dataset containing animals, I had one Lion Class, one Tiger Class, and one mixed class (containing multiple animals). I then trained and tested the model over these classes.

The dataset used to train this model can be found here- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals
## Pose Model
- For the Pose model, I used the dataset containing multiple Yoga poses. I divided it into multiple classes, with each class a separate yoga pose. I then trained and tested the model over these classes.

## Audio Model
The dataset can be found here- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gendubali/47-yoga-pose-detection
- For the Audio model, I created 20 samples of background noise using my own audio. For training the model, I recorded my voice to create samples and trained and tested the model.
