## Assignment 2
This assignment involves a deep dive into the world of Language Model Models (LLMs), including a series of experiments with both closed and open-source models as highlighted in key references. The assignment showcases the adaptability and creativity in AI applications, with a focus on prompt-based generation, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and more. The primary objective is to replicate a series of experiments with LLMs, adapting them for alternative tasks using different datasets available at Hugging Face. This assignment encourages creativity in modifying the Colab notebooks to highlight new use cases and applications of LLMs.

## Tasks
- **Experiment Replication:** Aim to replicate the series of experiments featured in the specified YouTube videos, covering all critical components including prompt-based generation, fine-tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), utilization of a local interpreter, executing function calls, and employing llama.cpp for CPU inference.

- **Innovative Adaptation:** Modify the provided Colab notebooks inspired by the YouTube tutorials to showcase unique and novel applications and uses of Language Model Models (LLMs).

- **Notebook Optimization:** Apply any necessary changes to the Colab notebooks to ensure their optimal functioning. Thoroughly document these changes for clarity and reference.

- **Utilizing Summarized Content:** It's crucial to use the condensed versions of the YouTube content provided by Summarize.tech. These summaries offer a comprehensive overview and serve as an excellent starting point for the experimental endeavors.

- **Demonstration of Skills:** This assignment is an opportunity to demonstrate the proficiency in accurately duplicating and innovatively expanding upon the experiments. It also tests the ability to meticulously document and effectively present the findings. Should you face any challenges or require slight modifications to the Colab notebooks, do not hesitate to seek assistance.
