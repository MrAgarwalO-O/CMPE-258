# Keras-CV for Various Vision Tasks

This assignment outlines the utilization of Keras-CV for various computer vision tasks, including object detection using the YOLO model, inference with a pretrained classifier, fine-tuning a pretrained backbone, training an image classifier from scratch, and training a custom object detection model. Each task leverages the capabilities of Keras-CV to handle complex vision tasks with ease.

## Overview

Keras-CV provides a comprehensive suite of tools and models for computer vision applications. This document explores five key tasks:

1. **Object Detection Using YOLO Model:** Detecting objects within images using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model.
2. **Inference with a Pretrained Classifier:** Utilizing a pretrained model to classify images without additional training.
3. **Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Backbone:** Adjusting a pretrained model on a specific dataset to improve performance.
4. **Training an Image Classifier from Scratch:** Building and training an image classification model from the ground up.
5. **Training Custom Object Detection Model:** Developing a custom model for object detection tailored to specific requirements.

### 1. Object Detection Using YOLO Model

This task involves using the YOLO model for detecting objects within images. It is a popular choice for real-time object detection due to its speed and accuracy.

### 2. Inference with a Pretrained Classifier

In this scenario, a pretrained model, such as ResNet50, is used to classify images into predefined categories. This approach is useful for applications that require immediate insights from images without the need for custom training.

### 3. Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Backbone

Fine-tuning involves adjusting a pretrained model to improve its accuracy on a specific dataset. This process can significantly enhance model performance, especially for tasks where the target domain differs from the one the model was originally trained on.

### 4. Training an Image Classifier from Scratch

For tasks that require a highly customized approach, training an image classifier from scratch allows for complete control over the model architecture and training process. This approach is ideal for novel applications where pretrained models may not provide sufficient accuracy.

### 5. Training Custom Object Detection Model

Developing a custom object detection model involves designing a model architecture tailored to the specific requirements of the detection task. This process allows for optimizing model performance for unique datasets or detection tasks that are not well-served by standard models.
