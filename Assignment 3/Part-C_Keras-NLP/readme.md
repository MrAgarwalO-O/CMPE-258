# Keras-NLP for Various NLP Tasks

This assignment provides an overview of utilizing Keras-NLP for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including inference with a pretrained classifier, fine-tuning a pretrained backbone, fine-tuning with user-controlled preprocessing, and fine-tuning custom models. These tasks encompass a range of activities from sentiment analysis to customizing NLP models for specific datasets, showcasing the versatility of Keras-NLP.

## Overview

Keras-NLP offers a high-level, easy-to-use API for handling a wide array of NLP tasks. This document covers four primary tasks:

1. **Inference with a Pretrained Classifier:** Utilizing a pretrained model to classify new text data without additional training.
2. **Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Backbone:** Adjusting a pretrained model on a specific dataset to improve its performance for particular tasks.
3. **Fine-Tuning with User-Controlled Preprocessing:** Modifying preprocessing steps to better suit the needs of the data and task at hand.
4. **Fine-Tuning Custom Models:** Building and training custom NLP models tailored to unique requirements.

### 1. Inference with a Pretrained Classifier

The process involves using a pretrained model (DistilBERT) to predict the sentiment of a given text. This method leverages the `transformers` library to load the model and tokenizer, preprocess the input text, and classify it into predefined categories such as positive or negative sentiment.

### 2. Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Backbone

Fine-tuning adapts a pretrained model (BERT) to a specific dataset, which can significantly improve performance on the target task. This method involves loading a dataset, preprocessing it, and then training (fine-tuning) the model on this data. Keras-NLP facilitates this process through high-level APIs, allowing for straightforward implementation.

### 3. Fine-Tuning with User-Controlled Preprocessing

This approach gives users control over the preprocessing steps, enabling customization according to the dataset's peculiarities. By manually preprocessing the data and then feeding it into a model, users can optimize model performance for specific tasks. The Keras-NLP library provides tools for both preprocessing and model construction, offering flexibility in how data is prepared and processed.

### 4. Fine-Tuning Custom Models

For tasks that require bespoke solutions, Keras-NLP supports the construction and fine-tuning of custom models. This involves designing a model architecture tailored to the specific needs of the task, including custom layers and training procedures. Users can start with a pretrained backbone, such as BERT, and extend it with additional layers or modifications to suit their requirements.

## Implementation Highlights

- **Keras-NLP** makes it simpler to implement complex NLP tasks with prebuilt models and preprocessing tools.
- **Flexibility and Customization:** Offers various levels of customization, from simple inference with pretrained models to the development of entirely custom architectures.
- **Ease of Use:** High-level APIs and the integration with TensorFlow and Keras streamline the process of model training, evaluation, and inference.
- **Performance Optimization:** Supports techniques such as batching, prefetching, and caching to enhance training and inference performance.
